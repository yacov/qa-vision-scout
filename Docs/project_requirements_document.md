# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for TestHub

## 1. Project Overview

TestHub is an internal, web-based tool designed specifically for the QA department to facilitate the thorough testing of new website designs and functionalities. Aimed at streamlining website testing procedures, TestHub enables users to compare new webpage versions against baseline models and assess their responsiveness across a wide array of devices and operating systems. This is achieved through the integration of the Browserstack API to take screenshots of baseline and new website, optimizing the evaluation process by automating it and ensuring that any discrepancies in layout, functionality, and visual consistency are readily apparent.

Built with the intent to enhance efficiency in webpage testing, TestHub's primary goal is to reduce manual effort while improving output quality by providing a centralized platform for test management and analysis. Success is defined by the tool's ability to deliver detailed, high-quality visualizations on an intuitive dashboard, thereby increasing the speed and accuracy of testing cycles. This empowers QA teams to detect and address design inconsistencies swiftly before deployment, enriching the overall user experience across various platforms.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope:

*   **Webpage Comparison**: Automating the comparison between new and baseline webpages screenshots using user-provided URLs.
*   **Responsiveness Testing**: Evaluating webpage performance across various OS, devices, and resolutions using the Browserstack API.
*   **Dashboard Visualization**: Presenting test results through an interactive dashboard with data visualization tools like Three.js, D3.js, and P5.js.
*   **AI-Assisted Analysis**: Leveraging AI models to enhance the accuracy of visual comparisons by detecting discrepancies.
*   **Reporting**: Ability to export detailed test reports in clipboard, PDF and CSV formats, with direct export functionality to Asana.
*   **User Roles and Permissions**: Roles including QA Tester, Departmental Manager, Customer Support Staff, and Administrator with varying levels of access.

### Out-of-Scope:

*   **Advanced Reporting Features**: Integration with further project management tools beyond Asana.

## 3. User Flow

When a new user logs into TestHub, they are greeted by a user-friendly dashboard. Initially, users provide URLs for both the baseline and new webpage versions they wish to compare. They select configurations such as operating systems, devices, and browsers, needed for testing. The platform then triggers the Browserstack API to capture screenshots following those configurations.\

The AI comparing screenshots and gets results.

Results from these automated tests populate on the dashboard, visually enhanced via Three.js, D3.js, and P5.js libraries, making data easy to consume. Users have the option to export these findings into detailed reports, either in PDF or CSV formats, suitable for integration with tools like Asana for project management. The dashboard facilitates quick navigation with a streamlined interface, allowing users to switch between responsiveness results, visual comparison analysis, and test reports with ease.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Authentication and User Management**: Managed through Supabase.
*   **Webpage Comparison Module**: Automatic detection of discrepancies in page layout, design, and functional elements.
*   **Device Responsiveness Tester**: Real-time assessment of webpages across chosen configurations using Browserstack API.
*   **Interactive Dashboard**: Central hub for visualization of testing data, integrated with advanced tools like Three.js, D3.js, and P5.js.
*   **Exportable Reports**: Generate PDFs and CSVs to share findings, with built-in functionality for Asana integration.
*   **AI Integration**: Integration of AI for automated visual comparisons to enhance detection accuracy, using latest Gemini vision models.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend**: Frontend: To ensure compatibility with lovable designs, we'll be using frameworks and libraries that support high levels of customization and user interaction. Additionally, focus will be on creating fluid animations and a responsive interface..
*   **Visualization Tools**: Three.js, D3.js, P5.js for enhanced data visualization.
*   **Backend & Storage**: Supabase is used for both database management and authentication.
*   **API**: Integration with Browserstack API for real-time responsiveness testing.
*   **AI Models**: Inclusion of tools like Gemini, Claude AI and ChatGPT o1 for advanced functionalities.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance**: Fast response and load times for testing results display on the dashboard.
*   **Security**: Ensuring all user data and webpages screenshots are securely managed and backed through robust authentication practices of Supabase.
*   **Usability**: A clean, professional user interface that facilitates user-centric design principles.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Availability**: Reliance on Browserstack API implies dependence on its service availability.
*   **AI Integration**: Subject to the robustness and accuracy of the chosen AI models.
*   **Data Management**: Handling of sensitive data in a secure environment per standard industry practice.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Limitations**: Potential rate limits of Browserstack API might affect testing frequency.
*   **Visualization Complexity**: Complex data visualizations might require significant processing power, affecting performance.
*   **AI Discrepancies**: Dependence on AI for detecting visual inconsistencies may occasionally result in false positives or missed irregularities. Ensuring a balance between manual and automated checks would be prudent.

This PRD is crafted to ensure clarity and precision, laying a firm foundation for all further technical documentation. Every element is tailored to ensure no room for guesswork, hence enabling the seamless generation of consequent documents.
