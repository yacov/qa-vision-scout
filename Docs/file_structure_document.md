# File Structure Document for TestHub

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is essential for the TestHub project to support efficient development and collaborative efforts among team members. It ensures clarity, eases navigation, and facilitates the management of the project's components. TestHub, designed to streamline QA testing of web pages using tools like Browserstack API and AI for automated visual comparisons, requires a structure that accommodates both frontend and backend functionalities along with powerful data visualization and user management.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

TestHub employs a robust tech stack consisting of Next.js 14 for the frontend with a focus on TypeScript for reliability and Tailwind CSS for styling. Visualization is powered by Three.js, D3.js, and P5.js, ensuring that data is effectively communicated through an intuitive interface. The backend leverages Supabase, which manages database interactions, authentication, and storage needs. Integration with Browserstack and potential AI tools like Claude AI and ChatGPT are essential for enhanced testing processes. This tech stack informs the file structure by necessitating directories and files specific to frontend components, backend operations, and integrated services.

## Root Directory Structure

At the root level of the project, you will find several key directories and files that are foundational to the project's organization. The main directories include `src` for source codes, `public` for static assets, and `config` for configuration settings. The root also contains configuration files like `.env` for environment variables, `package.json` for managing dependencies, and a `README.md` file for essential project documentation. These components provide a top-level overview and setup for developers entering the project.

## Frontend File Structure

The frontend part of TestHub is housed within the `src` directory under a `frontend` folder. This includes:

*   a `components` directory for reusable UI components designed using shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons.
*   a `pages` directory for Next.js routing, containing individual page components that utilize the application router.
*   a `styles` directory where Tailwind CSS is employed for global and component-level styling, following a consistent design language.
*   an `assets` directory for image storage and any static files needed. By segmenting the frontend this way, the project achieves modularity and reusability, allowing developers to easily find and modify components as needed.

## Backend File Structure

In the `src` directory, you will also find a `backend` folder containing the server-side configurations. This is structured into directories for `controllers`, `routes`, `models`, and `services`:

*   `controllers` contain functions handling incoming requests and executing appropriate logic.
*   `routes` define endpoint paths and connect them to controllers.
*   `models` define the database schema using Supabase's tools.
*   `services` host business logic and any integrations such as Browserstack API interactions. This structure supports maintainability and scalability, ensuring backend operations are cleanly separated and logically arranged.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration files located mainly in the `config` directory play a crucial role. They include API keys and settings necessary for service integrations, housed in files such as `browserstack.config.js`. The `.env` file manages sensitive data like environment variables securely. These files are integral in aligning the development environment with production settings, thereby ensuring consistency and security.

## Testing and Documentation Structure

Testing files reside in a `tests` directory, separated into units pertinent to frontend and backend testing, utilizing frameworks compatible with the chosen stack. Comprehensive documentation is maintained in a `docs` directory, detailing usage, setup, and workflow of the tool, supporting quality assurance and knowledge sharing among members of the team.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

This organized file structure supports TestHub in efficiently handling development and maintenance tasks. It is designed to accommodate the unique blend of frontend visualization and robust backend operations, ensuring clarity and promoting effective collaboration. By adhering to a structure that separates concerns and maintains clean divisions between different functionalities, TestHub distinguishes itself as both a powerful and user-friendly tool.
